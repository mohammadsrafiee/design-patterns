/**
 * <p>
 * <strong>Builder</strong> is a creational design pattern, which allows constructing
 * complex objects step by step.
 * Unlike other creational patterns, Builder does not require products to have a common interface.
 * That makes it possible to produce different products using the same construction process.
 * The Builder pattern is a well-known pattern in Java world. Itâ€™s especially useful when you
 * need to create an object with lots of possible configuration options.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         <strong><em>Intent</em></strong>: The Builder pattern is used when you want to create
 *         complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of a complex object from its
 *         representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
 *         to its subclasses.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <strong><em>Usage</em></strong>: It's useful when you need to create objects with
 *         many optional parameters or configurations, and you want to ensure that the process
 *         is easy to understand and maintain.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <strong><em>Flexibility</em></strong>:  It provides more fine-grained control over
 *         the object construction process. Builders can be used to create objects with specific
 *         configurations, and they can enforce the order of construction steps.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Here are a few real-world use cases where the Builder pattern can be applied effectively:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         <strong><em>Database Query Builders</em></em></strong>: When constructing database queries,
 *         especially for SQL databases, you often have a variety of optional clauses like SELECT fields,
 *         WHERE conditions, JOINs, and ORDER BY. A query builder can help construct these queries step by
 *         step without having to deal with complex SQL strings directly.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <strong><em>Configuration Builders</em></em></strong>:In applications that require complex
 *         configurations with numerous options, such as setting up a server, configuring a game character,
 *         or creating a custom user interface, a builder can be used to construct and modify these
 *         configurations in a more readable and maintainable way.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <strong><em>Document Generation</em></em></strong>:When generating complex documents like HTML,
 *         XML, or JSON, a builder can help create the structure and content of the document piece by piece.
 *         For instance, in generating HTML pages, you can have builders for headers, paragraphs, tables,
 *         and other HTML elements.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <strong><em>Immutable Objects</em></em></strong>: In languages that encourage immutability,
 *         such as Java, you can use a builder to create immutable objects with a large number of properties.
 *         The builder allows you to set each property individually and then build an immutable instance when all
 *         properties are set.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <strong><em>Mailing Systems</em></em></strong>:When sending emails or messages, you may have
 *         various optional components like attachments, headers, and recipients. A message builder can be
 *         used to construct these messages by adding or removing components as needed.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
